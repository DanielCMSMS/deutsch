		Modal verbs in English add more detail to verbs in a sentence. The words <i>can, must, </i>and <i>would</i> are examples of modal verbs:
		</p>
		<p>
		I am eating lunch.<br>
		I <i>can</i> eat lunch.
		</p>
		<p>
		I am studying for the test.<br>
		I <i>must</i> study for the test.
		</p>
		<p>Like in English, modal verbs exist in German. Some examples are the words <i>koennen, muessen, sollen, wollen, </i>and <i>duerfen</i>. There are key differences on how modals are used in German.</p>

		Modal verbs in English add more detail to verbs in a sentence. The words <i>can, must, </i>and <i>would</i> are examples of modal verbs:
		</p>
		<p>
		I am eating lunch.<br>
		I <i>can</i> eat lunch.
		</p>
		<p>
		I am studying for the test.<br>
		I <i>must</i> study for the test.
		</p>
		<p>Like in English, modal verbs exist in German. Some examples are the words <i>können, müssen, sollen, wollen, </i>and <i>dürfen</i>. There are key differences on how modals are used in German.</p>
		<p>The first is that a model verb is conjugated and used like any other verb, but the regular verb that it modifies is placed at the end of the sentence in the infinitive.</p>
		<p>
		<i>Ich kann meine Hausaufgabe machen.</i><br>
		Translation: I can do my homework.
		</p>
		<p>In the above sentence, <i>können</i> is conjugated (irregularly) for the first person and placed like any other verb. However, <i>machen</i> stays at the end of the sentence.</p>
		<p>The other key difference is that the five modal verbs mentioned are all conjugated irregularly, with the exception of <i>sollen</i>. Here are their conjugations for the present tenses:</p>
